Express: Input some data to find out how much a coveted cryptocurrency would be worth in today's fiat had you pulled the gun all those moons ago. 2. Historical: Print out all or some of the historical data of a chosen coin. 3. 3. Portfolio: Create or load a portfolio with as many wallets as you'd like to find out what your theoretical portfolio would have been worth today and what your profits or losses might have looked like.
